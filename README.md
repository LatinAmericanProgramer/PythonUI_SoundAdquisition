# PythonUI_SoundAdquisition
This is a simple user interface (UI) made with QtDesigner and Python. This UI allow us to upload a .WAV sound (as a PCG signal), see the plott and play it.

To run this program two files are neeeded:

1. A .ui file created and available to modify in QtDesigner. In this program this file is called "PCG_ui_1.ui"

2. A .py file which uploads the graphical configuration of this .ui file and adds the control commands

I this short repository I had also upload a phonocardiogram recording in .WAV to test the program.

NOTE: This program works just with .WAV files
